## Using Details Tag in Markdown

```html
<details>
<summary>CLICK ME</summary>

...
</details>
```

This section can be expanded or collapsed, providing a clean way to organize content. The `details` HTML tag is beneficial for enhancing readability and user experience by allowing users to toggle the visibility of additional information.

### Explanation
The usage of the `details` tag is straightforward. Hereâ€™s how it functions:
- `<details>`: This tag creates a disclosure widget from which the user can obtain additional information or controls.
- `<summary>`: This tag specifies a summary or heading for the `details` content. It is always visible, serving as a toggle for the expandable section.
- The content within the `details` tag will be hidden by default and can be revealed by clicking on the summary.
